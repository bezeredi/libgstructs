libgstructs
===========

Simple ANSI C Graph Structures Library. This is generic graph structures
library written in ANSI C. As of this moment, the implementations are not
intended to be C++ compatible or thread-safe.

The list of graph structures that will be included will be those that are
fairly commonplace, including, but not limited to, vertices; edges; vertex and
edge sets; distance, neighbor, and adjacency matrices; distance, neighbor, and
adjacency lists; and common algorithms for graph traversals.
